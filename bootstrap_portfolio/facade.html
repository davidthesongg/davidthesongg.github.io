		<p>
			Hey guys! this is my final project for Art 74. I chose to draw a face of someone considered to be the face of Korea. He was considered to be physically the most attractive actor in 2022. However, even though he was viewed by many as perfect on the outside, he has revealed that he has a lot of mental struggles and stress from pressure from both his work and personal life.
</br></br> My project symbolizes how even though someone can seem normal and perfect on the outside, only they know what goes on inside their head. Whether it be stress from school, family, personal life, relationships, etc... everyone goes through tough times in life. Ultimately, it is whether one can persevere through those trying times that matters.
